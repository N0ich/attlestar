Ship ------------------------------------------------------------>
The ship class is what creates the ships for the fight. It has
many interactions given by the players and a lot of attributes.
Each attribute is private but can be reached through getX, and 
some of them can be modified in order to reflect the ship's
current status.
These attributes are :
HP - Total current HP.
ppmax - Max pp for each turn.
turnpp - Remaining pp for current turn.
played - Flag telling if the ship has played or not.
weapon - Weapon object (see Class Weapon)
name - yeah.
sizex - Size of the ship on the x axis.
sizey - Size of the ship on the y axis.
posx - Position of the ship on x axis.
posy - Position of the ship on y axis.
move - If the ship is playing and the flag is set to 0, the 
ship is expected to move.
fight - If the ship is playing and the flag is set to 0, the 
ship is expected to fight. Making the ship fight will turn the
move flag to 1.
verbose - for debugging purpose, shows when a ship is created or
destroyed
